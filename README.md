## üîç Overview

**TorCommander** is a lightweight, open-source Linux tool that anonymizes terminal command executions by routing traffic through the **Tor network**. Designed with simplicity and privacy in mind, it helps users protect their identity and bypass restrictive firewalls.

Inspired by cybersecurity advocate **Dr. Jones Birch**, the project takes the concept further‚Äîoffering a practical, minimal, and easily extensible tool for secure, command-line-based internet access.

## üöÄ Features

- üîê **Tor Integration** ‚Äì Automatically channels commands through the Tor network.
- üß† **Toralization via Keyword** ‚Äì Just use `toralize` before a command to anonymize it.
- üåç **IP & Location Masking** ‚Äì Your real IP address and geolocation stay hidden.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **LD_PRELOAD Technique** ‚Äì Seamlessly intercepts network calls using dynamic linking.
- üìö **Educational & Research Friendly** ‚Äì Great for learning about system-level privacy and dynamic linking.
- üìÅ **Modular Codebase** ‚Äì Clean structure with `toralize.c`, `toralize.h`, and `Makefile` for easy builds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following dependencies are installed on your Linux system:

- **Tor**
- **GCC**
- **Make**

### Steps

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor gcc make
```

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anay-Patil/torcommander.git
cd torcommander
```

2. **Compile the program**:
```bash
make
```

3. **Install the `toralize` script globally**:

There are **two approaches** to use `toralize` globally:

### Approach 1: With Provided Script
If the `toralize.sh` script is already available:
```bash
sudo cp toralize.sh /usr/bin/toralize
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/toralize
```

### Approach 2: Manually Create the Script
If you do not have `toralize.sh`, manually create it:
```bash
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\nexport LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/toralize.so\n${@}\nunset LD_PRELOAD' | sudo tee /usr/bin/toralize > /dev/null
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/toralize
```
> Replace `/path/to/toralize.so` with the actual path where `toralize.so` is located, for example `/home/user/TorCommander/toralize.so`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If a command doesn't work properly, try using:
```bash
toralize curl --resolve http://example.com
```

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

To run any command anonymously, just prefix it with `toralize`:
```bash
toralize curl http://check.torproject.org
```

### Supported Commands
The following types of commands are compatible:
- `curl`, `wget`, `ping`
- Any command making socket-based network calls
- DNS resolution and TCP-based communication tools

> Note: Not all system commands go through the network; `toralize` affects only those that do.
